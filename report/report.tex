\begin{itemize}
\item[A1:]
For an array of size $N$ the labeled statement
\texttt{insertion\_sort\_move} might be executed from $0$ (sorted) to
$N\times(N-1)/2$ (reverse order) times (in our case for an array of 32 
elements from 0 to 496). 

\item[A2:] 

  Assume that the length of the input array is $N$.

  After an inspection of the sorting algorithm one can see that the
  algoritm behaviour does not depend on the exact values of the input
  array.
  It only depends on the relations between the array elements.
  The reason is that the array elements are only compared by
  relational operarors like ``$>$'' and the only operation invoked on
  array elements is copying.
  This means that control-flow path is the same for two arrays of
  lenght $N$ with the same distribution of elements inversions.

  In the very general case two arbitrary elements $a$ and $b$ of the
  input array can be related as $a<b$, $a=b$ or $a>b$, and the
  execution path might be influenced by this fact in three different
  ways.
  The total number of permutations, that take into account equalities
  and inversions, for arrays of length $N$ can be expressed as

  \begin{equation}
	\sum_{n=1}^N \ \ \sum_{\substack{
	  \bigwedge_{i=1}^n m_i \geq 1 
	  \\ \sum_{i=1}^n m_i = N}} \binom N {m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n}.
	  \label{equ:genpath}
	\end{equation}

	Potentially, each of these arrays might cause a sorting algorithm
	to follow a unique execution path.
	However, in the case of insertion sort algorithm we know that
	relations $a<b$ and $a=b$ cannot be distinguished.
	This reduces the number of paths accordint to~(\ref{equ:genpath})
	to the number of $N!$.
	A simpler explanation can be provided in this case.
	When the insertion sort algorithm processes the element at the
	position~$i$ ($1 \leq i \leq N$), all the elements at the previous
	positions $1\ldots i-1$ are already sorted.
	For the element $i$ there are now exactly $i$ positions to be
	placed.
	This adds a factor $i$ to the number of total pths that should be
	executed.
	Hence, we get for the total number of path an expression

	%\begin{equation}
	$$
	  \prod_{i=1}^N i = N!.
	$$
	%\end{equation}



           
\item[A3:] 
The minimum execution time (in processor cycles) is $t_1 = 5477$
for the sorted array, the maximum is $t_2 = 30083$ for elements in
reverse order as well as for an array of equal elements (e.g. all
zeros). Sorting an array of random elements takes `usually' 17/18k cycles.
For details see Figure~\ref{fig:opt_compare}.

\subsection{Solution}

\begin{itemize}

\item[A1:]

The results of WCET static analysis, obtained with \texttt{a3patmos}
tool (column 2), are summarized in the table below:

\begin{tabular}{ | r | r | r |}
\hline
Array size & WCET (cycles) & Measured \\\hline
8  & 6512 & - \\\hline
16 & 22888 & - \\\hline
32 & 46904 & 30083 \\\hline
64 & 330808 & - \\\hline
\end{tabular}

For an array of 32 elements \texttt{a3patmos} gives result which is
approximately 1.5 times larger then the largest measurement. 
If the 'triangulation' structure of the loops is not
imposed as a constraint, the result is even more
pessimistic (85.5k cycles for array size of 32).

\item[A2:]
Number of inversions in the input array has significant impact on
the execution time. In order to take it into
account during static WCET analysis, we add linear
constraint for maximum number of inversions in the inner loop.

\item[A3:]
For this task we modify \texttt{Makefile} and include corresponding
\texttt{insertion\_sort\_O1.*} targets.
We also define annotations in a separate file (aiT.ais, see listing or supplement).
The differences between execution times for the test cases 
and the WCET are summarized in the Figure~\ref{fig:opt_compare}.
Optimizations performed by compiler  reduce execution
time by approximately factor of 3. The pitfall here is
that the control flow graph from \texttt{a3patmos} tool does not give 
the valid addresses of instructions corresponding to \texttt{insertion\_sort\_move}:
to solve this issue we obtain the addresses from the disassembly file
(after analysing \texttt{insertion\_sort} assembly code).

  \texttt{-O1}}
	\label{fig:opt_compare}
\end{figure}


\item[A4:] 
In order to perform the analysis we build a directed graph that assigns execution time to edges but not vertices~(Fig.~\ref{fig:ilp}).
This is done by moving execution time from each block (corresponding to a vertex) to its outgoing edges.
The same value (equal to the corresponding block execution cost) is assigned to all outgoing edges.
Since we do not have outgoing edges form the block \texttt{while.end12}, we add one more vertex to the graph (which we call \texttt{exit}) and an edge between vertices \texttt{while.end12} and \texttt{exit}.
The cost of \texttt{while.end12} block is assigned to the new edge.

  \caption{Control-Flow Graph for ILP problem formulation}
  \label{fig:ilp}
\end{figure}

A cost value and a number of executions is associated with each edge of the graph, such that the edge $i$ has the cost $t_i$ and the number of executions $x_i$ correspondingly.
The ILP problem consists of the objective function and the constraints.
The objective function is maximization of the execution time:
\begin{equation}
\max_{x_1, x_2, \ldots x_{12}} \ \sum_{i=1}^{12} x_i t_i.
\label{equ:objective}
\end{equation}

The constraints reflect the facts we know about control-flow of the function.
The node constraints describe the fact that each program block is entered and left exactly the same number of times:
\begin{equation}
	\left.\begin{aligned}
		x_2 + x_3	&= x_1 + x_{11}\\
		x_2			&= x_4\\
		x_4 + x_{10}	&= x_5 + x_6\\
		x_5			&= x_7 + x_8\\
		x_7			&= x_9\\
		x_8			&= x_{10}\\
		x_6 + x_9	&= x_{11}\\
		x_3			&= x_{12}
	\end{aligned}\right.
\label{equ:node}
\end{equation}
This control flow constraints itself cannot give a finite solution because of cycles in the graph.
Thus, we add a requirement of a single function entrance and function exit or infinite looping:
\begin{equation}
	\left.\begin{aligned}
		x_1			&= 1\\
		x_{12}		&\leq 1
	\end{aligned}\right.
\label{equ:single}
\end{equation}
This additional requirements still do not make the solution finite.
We should add the constraints that describe loop bounds.
We suppose that the length of the input array is $N$.
From the previously done analysis we know that in this case the outer loop is executed exactly $N$ times and the inner loop---not more than $N(N-1)/2$.
Hence, we add
\begin{equation}
	\left.\begin{aligned}
		x_{11}		&= N\\
		x_{10}		&\leq N(N-1)/2
	\end{aligned}\right.
\label{equ:loops}
\end{equation}
Finally, there are physical feasibility constraints:
\begin{equation}
		x_i \in \mathbb{N}, \quad \mathrm{where}\ 1 \leq i \leq 12
\label{equ:feasibility}
\end{equation}
All the constraints (\ref{equ:objective}--\ref{equ:feasibility}) formulate the ILP problem for IPET analysis.
Equation (\ref{equ:feasibility}) should be passed to the solver through the type information, i.e. the solver will treat the variables as natural numbers implicitly.

The problem can be solved every time for each specific $N$ and $t_{1} \ldots t_{12}$.
However, the intuition and previous analysis say that the WCET should always correspond to the case when the inner loop is executed $N(N-1)/2$ times.
Since the problem is not large, we can try to prove it analytically.

First of all, eliminate the redundant variables in node constraints:
\begin{equation}
	\left.\begin{aligned}
		x_2 + x_3	&= 1 + N\\
		x_2 + x_8	&= x_5 + x_6\\
		x_5			&= x_7 + x_8\\
		x_6 + x_7	&= N\\
	\end{aligned}\right.
\label{equ:node_simpl}
\end{equation}
and prove termination of the \texttt{insertion\_sort} function.
Termination is formulated as $x_{12} = 1$.
From $x_3 = x_{12}$ and $x_{12} \leq 1$ we conclude $x_3 \leq 1$, i.e. we should prove that $x_3 = 1$ but not $x_3 = 0$.

Suppose that $x_3 = 0$.
From (\ref{equ:node_simpl}) we have
\begin{equation*}
	\left\{\begin{aligned}
		x_2			&= 1 + N\\
		x_2 + x_8	&= x_5 + x_6\\
		x_5			&= x_7 + x_8\\
		x_6 + x_7	&= N\\
	\end{aligned}\right.
\Rightarrow
	\left\{\begin{aligned}
		1 + N + x_8	&= x_7 + x_8 + x_6\\
		x_6 + x_7	&= N\\
	\end{aligned}\right.
\Rightarrow
	\left\{\begin{aligned}
		x_6 + x_7 	&= N+1\\
		x_6 + x_7	&= N\\
	\end{aligned}\right.
\end{equation*}
which is a contradiction.
Thus, $x_3 = x_{12} = 1$.
Taking this into account and $x_8 = x_{10} \leq N(N-1)/2$ we can further reduce our set of constraints.
Additionally, we can remove constants from the objective function.
After simplification the ILP problem looks as
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	\max_{x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8} \left(t_5 x_5 + t_5 x_6 + (t_7+t_9)x_7 + (t_7+t_{10}) x_8 \right)\\
	\left.\begin{aligned}
		N + x_8		&= x_5 + x_6\\
		x_5			&= x_7 + x_8\\
		x_6 + x_7	&= N\\
		x_8			&\leq N(N-1)/2
	\end{aligned}\right.
\end{aligned}
\label{equ:ilp}
\end{equation}
and we know that $x_1 = x_3 = x_{12} = 1$, $x_2 = x_4 = x_{11} = N$, $x_9 = x_7$ and $x_{10} = x_8$.

Suppose that we have a solution $\{x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8\}$ of (\ref{equ:ilp}), for which $x_8 < N(N-1)/2$.
One can easily see that this solution is not the optimal.
The solution $\{x'_5 = x_5+1, x'_6 = x_6, x'_7 = x_7, x'_8 = x_8+1\}$ gives a larger value of the optimization function under assumption $t_5 + t_7 + t_{10} > 0$.
For any realistic implementation the assumption is true.
We can increment $x_5$ and $x_8$ until $x_8 = N(N-1)/2$.
And this will give the maximum value of the optimization function for any particular $x_6$ and $x_7$.
Thus, we conclude $x_8 = N(N-1)/2$.

Now the ILP problem looks as 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	\max_{x_5, x_6, x_7} \left(t_5 x_5 + t_5 x_6 + (t_7+t_9)x_7 \right)\\
	\left.\begin{aligned}
		N + N(N-1)/2	&= x_5 + x_6\\
		x_5			&= x_7 + N(N-1)/2\\
		x_6 + x_7	&= N\\
	\end{aligned}\right.
\end{aligned}
\label{equ:ilp2}
\end{equation}
where the last constraint is redundant (it is a sum of two other constraints).

To solve problem (\ref{equ:ilp2}) we express
\begin{equation*}
	\left.\begin{aligned}
		x_6 = N(N+1)/2 - x_5\\
		x_7 = x_5 - N(N-1)/2
	\end{aligned}\right.
\end{equation*}
and put it to the optimization function:
\begin{equation*}
	\left.\begin{aligned}
		\max_{x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8} \left(t_5x_5 + t_5x_6 + (t_7+t_9)x_7\right) =\\
		\max_{x_5} \left(t_5x_5 + t_5\left(\frac{N(N+1)}2 - x_5\right) + (t_7+t_9)\left(x_5 - \frac{N(N-1)}2\right)\right) \sim\\
		\max_{x_5} \left(t_5x_5 - t_5x_5 + (t_7+t_9)x_5\right) =\\
		\max_{x_5} \left((t_7+t_9)x_5\right) \sim\\
		\max_{x_5} x_5
	\end{aligned}\right.
\end{equation*}
under assumption $t_7+t_9 > 0$, which is true for any realistic implementation.

In order to maximize our optimization function we should maximize $x_5$, but this is infinity.
At this point the feasibility constraint $x_6 \geq 0$ comes into a play:
\begin{equation*}
x_6 = N(N+1)/2 - x_5 \geq 0
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
x_5 \leq N(N+1)/2
\end{equation*}
Clearly, the maximal possible value of $x_5$ is $N(N+1)/2$.
Finally, we find $x_6 = 0$, $x_7 = N$.

Our solution looks as following\\
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
\hline
$x_1$ & $x_2$ & $x_3$ & $x_4$ & $x_5$ & $x_6$ & $x_7$ & $x_8$ & $x_9$ & $x_{10}$ & $x_{11}$ & $x_{12}$ \\
\hline
%$1$ & $N$ & $1$ & $N$ & $N(N+1)/2$ & $0$ & $N$ & $N(N-1)/2$ & $N$ & $N(N-1)/2$ & $N$ & $1$ \\
$1$ & $N$ & $1$ & $N$ & $\frac{N(N+1)}2$ & $0$ & $N$ & $\frac{N(N-1)}2$ & $N$ & $\frac{N(N-1)}2$ & $N$ & $1$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\\
and the WCET is $\sum_{i=1}^{12} x_i t_i$.
The solution does not depend on the exact values of $t_1, t_2, \ldots t_{12}$, only assumptions $t_5 + t_7 + t_{10} > 0$ and $t_7+t_9 > 0$ are important.
For $N=32$ and cost values given in Fig.~\ref{fig:cfg.insertion_sort} the solution is\\
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
\hline
$x_1$ & $x_2$ & $x_3$ & $x_4$ & $x_5$ & $x_6$ & $x_7$ & $x_8$ & $x_9$ & $x_{10}$ & $x_{11}$ & $x_{12}$ & WCET\\
\hline
1 & 32 & 1 & 32 & 528 & 0 & 32 & 496 & 32 & 496 & 32 & 1  & 19571\\
\hline
\end{tabular}\\
The same values were obtaines with the \texttt{lp\_solve} solver that was run on the originaly composed constraints (\ref{equ:objective}--\ref{equ:feasibility}).

\subsection{Problem Statement}
\input{../assignment/problem3.tex}

\subsection{Solution}
\begin{itemize}

\item[A1:]
  To justify flow and loop constraints for
  \texttt{merge\_samples} we first need to state the following facts:
  number of samples that are used for analysis is 64
  (\texttt{SAMPLE\_COUNT}). At most 4 consecutive samples could be
  missing (\texttt{MAX\_CONSECUTIVE\_MISSING}). This means that
  minimum number of valid samples to perform the analysis is:
  $${\text{MIN}_\text{valid samples}}  = \lceil\frac{\texttt{SAMPLE\_COUNT}}{\texttt{MAX\_CONSECUTIVE\_MISSING} + 1}\rceil$$
  (in our case 13).
  
  \texttt{merge\_samples} has two nested loops and two conditional
  branches of interest (we do not consider the case when number of
  samples <= 0, where we exit without performing interpolation).

  The outer loop is executed for each sample (either valid or missing,
  64 times in total, line 3 of \texttt{ait\_merge\_samples} in the
  listing). Then we hit the first \texttt{if} statement: take the
  branch if current value is not missing. All values might be valid,
  hence we can take the branch 64 times (\texttt{ait\_merge\_samples}:
  lines 6 and 11). Now, the current sample is valid (line TODO in
  \texttt{merge\_samples}, see listing), but several previous  (up to
  4) samples might be missing. 
  We take the branch in the second \texttt{if} condition (\texttt{merge\_samples}: line
  TODO) if current sample is valid and one or several previous 
  samples are missing
  (the worst case when each second sample is missing -- we
  can take the branch max 32 times -- \texttt{ait\_merge\_samples}: lines 7
  and 12). We will use this fact as a flow
  constraint. The inner loop interpolates missing samples: at most 4
  might be missed consecutively, hence the loop bound for the inner
  loop is 4 (\texttt{ait\_merge\_samples}: line 4). 
  Max number of iteration of the inner loop:
  $$\text{MIN}_\text{valid samples} \times
  \text{MAX\_CONSECUTIVE\_MISSING}$$ which is equal to 52
  (\texttt{ait\_merge\_samples}: lines 5 and 10).

\item[A2:]
  Measurements for test bench implemented in
  \texttt{main.c:test\_merge\_samples()} are shown in the
  Figure~\ref{fig:mergeSamples}.
	The result of static analysis using \texttt{a3patmos} gives the
