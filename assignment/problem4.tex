\label{problem:4}

Next, analyze the \texttt{fft()} function called in \texttt{task.c}. Try to
find loop bounds for the Fast Fourier Transform implementation
(\texttt{fixedpoint.c:fp\_radix2fft\_withscaling()}) first, and add a flow
constraint relating the execution frequency of the inner loop's body with
the function's execution frequency.

\begin{itemize}

\item[Q1:]
  Describe and justify the flow facts found for
  \texttt{fp\_radix2fft\_withscaling}, and \texttt{fft}.

\item[Q2:]
  What is the maximum execution time observed for this function? What
  is the analyzed WCET?

\item[Q3:]
  For the FFT implementation \texttt{fp\_radix2fft\_withscaling}, is it safe to
  use the loop iteration counts observed during a test run? Justify your
  answer.

\item[Hint:]
  For measurements, you might want to rely on or start with the test
  implementation \texttt{main.c:test\_fft()}

\end{itemize}
