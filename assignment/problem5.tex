\label{problem:5}
The final goal is to analyze the WCET of \texttt{task.c:task()}.

\begin{itemize}

\item[Q1:]
  First, calculate the WCET of \texttt{check\_sin} and \texttt{check\_square}.
  Then, try to give a rough estimate on the WCET by combining the WCET's of
  \texttt{merge\_samples}, \texttt{fft}, \texttt{check\_sin} and
  \texttt{check\_square}. Clearly state how you combined the WCETs, and compare
  the resulting value with the maximum observed execution time of these
  functions, combined in the same way.

\item[Q2:]
  Add a flow fact for the indirect call in \texttt{task}, calculate the WCET of
  \texttt{task}, and compare it to the maximum execution time observed.

\end{itemize}
