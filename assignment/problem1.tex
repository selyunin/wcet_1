\label{problem:1}

In directory \texttt{insertion\_sort}, implement the function
\texttt{main.c:run()}. This routine should call the insertion
sort routine several times, with different arrays of size $32$.

\begin{itemize}
\item[Q1:] What is the minimum and maximum number of times the statement
           labeled \texttt{insertion\_sort\_move} might be
           executed for some input data (assuming an array size of $N$)?
\item[Q2:] How many test runs do you need to cover all possible paths through
           the function?
\item[Q3:] Report the minimum and maximum execution times measured for
           your test runs of insertion sort.
\end{itemize}
